Trash-Corresponding-Derived-Data
================================

A Folder Action which automatically trashes derived data (build products) when you move an Xcode project to the Trash.

If the items you move to the Trash contain any `.xcodeproj` files, then any folders in DerivedData that have the same name will also be moved to the Trash.
